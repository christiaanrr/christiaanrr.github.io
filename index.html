            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p class="lead"> Hello! I am Christian Rodriguez, a 19 year old college student who is currently attending
             University of California - Los Angeles. My family immigrated to the United States from the Philippines in
              September of 2004 in an attempt to live a better life. Although I come from a not-so privileged background,
              I am fortunate enough to have loving parents who support everything I do. I have three siblings, all of
              whom are male. When I am with my brothers, I love playing video games together. I especially enjoy
              playing basketball against them. My mom works two full-time jobs, while my dad stays at home and takes
              care of my siblings and I. I hope that one day I can repay my parents for everything they have done for me.</p>

                     individual and an engineer. Seeking to take upon challenging tasks in order to galvanize my

            <h2>John Marshall High School</h2>
            <p>I graduated as the student with the 5th highest GPA (4.375) out of a 480 senior student body.
            During my years at Marshall I took 10 AP classes and other honors classes. My most fond memories of high school stems from all of my sports activities. I played football for 2 years, basketball
             for 2 years, and ran track for all 4 years. I fortunately found sports activities as my safe haven.</p>

            <h2>UCLA</h2>
            <p>I am a mechanical engineering major who loves to have fun when I have free time. I like learning about
             about anything related to rockets, automobiles, or programming. Currently, I have a 3.504 GPA and is expected
             to graduate in June of 2020. I am currently involved in UCLA's Rocket Project, which has tremendously
             helped me learn about rocketry. UCLA has been noting but a stressful, yet enjoyable ride!</p>
